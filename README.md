# T-shirt Logo Design

## Disclaimer:
This is not about technical report or something like that. This is about my last memeory of Hall Residence. Have fun to browse it!

## Goal:
Hall Residence Activity aims to connect each other closely. I really happy to register it. I wanna share the idea of my logo design.

## Design Ideas:
1. I used clock as the outline to remind all of mates about the time. For most of them, this period might be the final phrase as a "student". Technically, we are not student anymore. In my humble opinion, undergraduate is my last student time.
2. The black bold circle framework with "BO YAN" means that the name of our hall residence is BO YAN.
3. The time "7.20 p.m" means we live on the 19th and 20th floors.
4. The front rendering. We hope that the front can be a little more concise.
5. The blackages on the cuffs and collars are to adda little bit of fun.
6. The black still remind all of you the importance of cherishing time. "Play Harder, Work Harder!"
